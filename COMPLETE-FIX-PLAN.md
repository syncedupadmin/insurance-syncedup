# 🎯 COMPLETE FIX PLAN - Insurance.SyncedUp

## ✅ COMPLETED

### Phase 1: Authentication (DONE)
- ✅ Re-enabled authentication on 10 critical APIs
- ✅ Fixed duplicate export statements
- ✅ All admin APIs now require authentication

### Phase 2: Agency Filtering (IN PROGRESS)
- ✅ Fixed `api/admin/agents.js` to filter by agency_id
- ⏳ Need to fix remaining admin APIs

## 🚧 REMAINING WORK

### Phase 2: Complete Agency Filtering (2 hours)

**Files that need agency filtering:**

1. **Admin Portal APIs** - Should filter by `req.user.agency_id`:
   - ✅ `api/admin/agents.js` (DONE)
   - ⏳ `api/admin/commission-settings.js`
   - ⏳ `api/admin/leaderboard-settings.js`
   - ⏳ `api/admin/payroll-export.js`
   - ⏳ `api/admin/reset-password.js`
   - ⏳ `api/admin/users-with-email.js`

2. **Manager Portal APIs** - Should filter by manager's team:
   - ⏳ Create `api/manager/team.js`
   - ⏳ Create `api/manager/dashboard.js`

3. **Agent Portal APIs** - Should filter by agent's own ID:
   - ✅ `api/agent/dashboard.js` (has auth, needs testing)

### Phase 3: Frontend Data Loading (1 hour)

**Fix hardcoded dashboard values:**

1. **Admin Dashboard** (`public/_admin/index.html`):
   - Replace `$0` with API call to `/api/admin/dashboard`
   - Load real revenue, users, sales data

2. **Agent Dashboard** (`public/_agent/index.html`):
   - Replace `$0` with API call to `/api/agent/dashboard`
   - Load real commissions, sales data

3. **Manager Dashboard** (`public/_manager/index.html`):
   - Create `/api/manager/dashboard`
   - Load team performance data

### Phase 4: Create Missing APIs (2 hours)

Create these essential endpoints:

1. **`api/quotes/index.js`**:
   - POST: Create quote (agent only)
   - GET: List quotes (filter by agent/agency)
   - PUT: Update quote
   - Connects to `quotes` table

2. **`api/sales/index.js`**:
   - POST: Record sale (agent/manager)
   - GET: List sales (filter by agent/agency)
   - Connects to `sales` table
   - Calculate commissions

3. **`api/agent/commissions.js`**:
   - GET: Agent's commission statements
   - Filter by agent_id
   - Calculate totals

### Phase 5: Testing (1 hour)

Test each portal's data isolation:

1. **Login as Admin** (admin@demo.com):
   - Should see only Demo Agency agents
   - Should NOT see Platinum Health agents

2. **Login as Super Admin** (admin@syncedupsolutions.com):
   - Should see ALL agencies
   - Should see ALL agents

3. **Login as Manager**:
   - Should see only their team
   - Should NOT see other managers' teams

4. **Login as Agent**:
   - Should see only their own data
   - Should NOT see other agents' data
