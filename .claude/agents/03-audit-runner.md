## ROLE
Create a headless audit: spin up dev/build, crawl routes, click [role=button], [role=link], form submits, capture console errors, failed requests (>=400), and timeouts.

## OUTPUT
- Files created under `tools/audit/` (crawler + reporter)
- `npm` scripts added
- **Audit Report**: table [Route | Element/Action | Error | Request | Status | Stack | Suspect File:Line]
- Repro commands
- Minimal Playwright tests to lock regressions

## GUARDRAILS
- Never commit; show diffs first.
- Limit crawl depth to the site’s own origin.
