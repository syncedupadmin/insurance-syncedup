# ðŸ§¹ CLEANUP DOCUMENTATION

## Overview
This cleanup was performed on September 6, 2024 to remove duplicate, test, and legacy files that could cause confusion during development and maintenance.

## Files Moved

### ðŸ“‚ duplicate-files/
**Purpose**: Files that had multiple versions or served duplicate purposes
- `agent-portal.html` - Duplicate of `/agent/index.html`
- `dashboard.html` - Duplicate of `/agent/index.html` 
- `dashboard-with-admin.html` - Special version of agent dashboard (not used)

### ðŸ“‚ test-files/
**Purpose**: Development and testing files that contained hardcoded credentials
- `auth-diagnostic.html` - Auth system diagnostic tool
- `debug-login.html` - Login debugging page
- `manual-test.html` - Manual testing interface
- `test-admin.html` - Admin endpoint testing (contained admin tokens)
- `test-auth.html` - Authentication testing
- `test-login.html` - Login testing
- `test-upload.html` - Upload functionality testing

### ðŸ“‚ backup-files/
**Purpose**: Legacy backup and archived files
- `goals-backup.html` - Backup of `/manager/goals.html`
- `index_old.html` - Old version of super-admin index
- `super-admin-portal.html.archived` - Archived super admin portal

### ðŸ“‚ misc-files/
**Purpose**: Miscellaneous files that were redundant or malformed
- `demo.html` - Admin demo page
- `leaderboard.html` - Duplicate of `/leaderboard/index.html`
- `UsersnichoProjectssyncedup-insurancevercel-appapiauthlogin.js` - Malformed JS file (0 bytes)

## Changes Made

### vercel.json Updated
- Fixed `/leaderboard` route to point to `/leaderboard/index.html` instead of removed `/leaderboard.html`

## Verification
All files were checked for references before moving:
- No HTML, CSS, or JS files referenced the moved files
- No navigation menus linked to the duplicate files
- All portal entry points remain functional

## Safety
Files were moved (not deleted) so they can be restored if needed. After confirming functionality for 1-2 weeks, these files can be permanently deleted.

## Current Portal Structure
After cleanup, each portal has a single clear entry point:
- `/admin` â†’ `/admin/index.html`
- `/manager` â†’ `/manager/index.html` 
- `/agent` â†’ `/agent/index.html`
- `/customer-service` â†’ `/customer-service/index.html`
- `/super-admin` â†’ `/super-admin/index.html`
- `/leaderboard` â†’ `/leaderboard/index.html`
