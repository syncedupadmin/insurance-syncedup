## Conclusion

✅ **ALL PORTALS NOW WORKING CORRECTLY**

The directory conflict issue has been completely resolved for all affected portals. The same root cause (old directories overriding Vercel rewrites) was fixed using the same solution (renaming to -OLD-DELETE).

All portals now properly serve from their underscore directories with the component-based navigation system (except super-admin which uses a different hardcoded design).
